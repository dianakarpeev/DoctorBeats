# 🐢 Mr. Beats - VR Therapeutic Game

Mr. Beats is a VR game designed to reduce pain and anxiety in children undergoing needle-based medical procedures. Built on decades of research in pediatric pain, neuroscience, and immersive media, Mr. Beats transforms the clinical experience from one of fear and trauma into one of creativity and calm.

Children are transported into a soothing underwater world filled with sensory elements proven to lower stress and pain perception. What makes Mr. Beats unique is its musical harmony system: as children explore, they interact with colorful seashells that each produce a musical tone. Because all sounds share a common scale, every combination forms a pleasant, cohesive soundscape. Children aren’t just tapping seashells—they’re composing. This creative process engages executive function and taps into neural pathways distinct from those involved in pain perception, helping to shift attention and emotional state. It fosters a sense of control and pride, while keeping children physically still.
The underwater setting itself is intentional—soft, flowing, and warm—symbolically recontextualizing the sharp, invasive sensation of a needle as something fluid and gentle.

A turtle companion named Mr. Beats guides the child through the experience, offering calming prompts and reinforcing emotional safety.

Mr. Beats isn’t just a distraction—it’s a new standard for compassionate pediatric care.

## 🐚 Our Purpose

Our teammate Astha, MD Canada at McGill, was helping with a routine blood test for a four-year-old girl with a chronic illness. She’d been getting bloodwork every two months since birth — and yet, the only protocol in place was to pin her down. No distraction, no emotional support — just restraint, while she screamed and cried.

And she remembers thinking: this can’t be what being a good healthcare professional means.

We know from research that procedural pain in childhood leads to lasting consequences: trauma, medical avoidance, even changes in pain processing. These early moments shape a child’s lifelong relationship with healthcare.

So we created Dr. Beats — a virtual reality experience designed specifically for these moments.

## 🪸 Event Details
We would like to extend our heartfelt thanks to McGill XR for organizing the [2025 NeuroVR Hackathon](https://www.mcgill.ca/virtualrealityforchildcare/channels/event/neurovr-hackathon-355881). This event provided us with a unique opportunity to develop this application alongside talented peers from diverse multidisciplinary backgrounds, while also receiving invaluable guidance from industry professionals.
